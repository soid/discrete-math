# Truth Table

This is a study project completed by Greg Temchenko for the Discrete Math class at Laney College by Derrick Smith.

The project is written in Scala and requires sbt to run (http://www.scala-sbt.org). 

## Description

For this project you will write a program that generates a truth table for a given propositional sentence. The
propositional letters will be p0, p1, p2, ‚Ä¶ ,pn and the following abbreviations will be used for the propositional
connectives:

```
v ‚áî ‚à®
^ ‚áî ‚àß
~ ‚áî ¬¨
> ‚áî ‚Üí
= ‚áî ‚Üî
```

The input will be a compound proposition fully parenthesized.

More specifically, the input will be a well-formed formula that adheres to the following definition.

(p0), (p1), (p2), ‚Ä¶ are all well-formed formulas.

If ùõó and ùõô are well-formed formulas, so are (ùõó ‚àß ùõô), (ùõó ‚à® ùõô), (ùõó ‚Üí ùõô), (ùõó ‚Üî ùõô), (¬¨ùõó) 

(Look at the section Recursive Definitions and Structural Induction in your textbook for a more detailed
explanation.)

E.g. If the proposition is ¬¨( p ‚Üí (q ‚à® r)), your input string would be (~((p0)>((p1)v(p2))))

(Trust me, as ugly as this looks it will make your parsing a lot easier.)

The output for this should be

```
p0 p1 p2 *
 T  T  T F
 T  T  F F
 T  F  T F
 T  F  F T
 F  T  T F
 F  T  F F
 F  F  T F
 F  F  F F
```

Your program should be able to handle an arbitrary number of propositional variables. Do not use an ‚Äúeval‚Äù type function , even if your language has one.


## Usage

Generating truth-table for a single proposition:

```
sbt 'run-main edu.laney.math55.TruthTable "( (~(p1)) v (p2) )"'
```

Generating truth-tables for multiple propositions:
```
sbt 'run-main edu.laney.math55.TruthTable "( p1 v (p2 ^ p3)  )"    "( (p1 v p2) ^ (p1 v p3) )"'
```

In general:
```
sbt 'run-main edu.laney.math55.TruthTable "proposition 1"   [ "proposition 2" ... ]'
```


Compilation only:

```
sbt compile
```
